## Visualising large datasets

Install and try visualising datasets from previous sessions with:

- {[`mapgl`](https://github.com/walkerke/mapgl/)}: an R interface to Mapbox GL JS for rendering large spatial datasets.
- {[`tmap.gl`](https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap.mapgl/)}: Use your existing `tmap` code, that builds on `mapgl`
- The {[`nptscot/pmtiles`](https://github.com/nptscot/pmtiles)} GitHub package provides tools for creating vector tiles in R (advanced).

## Route network integration
<!-- Weâ€™ll present ways to join different networks, e.g. OSM networks -->

- Take a read of the [networkmerge paper](https://nptscot/networkmerge) and try to reproduce some of the code
- Search for and download the Ordnance Survey's OpenRoads data product
- Check-out the [`stplanr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/) function [`rnet_join()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/reference/rnet_join.html) for joining different route networks, e.g. walking and cycling networks.
- Check-out the [`anime`](https://github.com/josiahparker/anime) package for astonishingly fast network joining (advanced).

## Deploying your work as web applications

- Think about the project that you're working on that would have the maximum benefit from being deployed as a web application.
- Sketch out the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the application.
- Sketch the data flow and architecture of backend systems.
- Read-up on the [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package for reproducible pipelines.
- Take a look at the source code of some deployed web applications for inspiration
- Check out the code in the [`nptscot/nptscot`](https://github.com/nptscot/npt) and [`nptscot/nptscot.github.io`](https://github.com/nptscot/nptscot.github.io) repositories, plus the resulting app at [npt.scot](https://npt.scot).
- Look for the source code associated with other apps including [pctni.org](https://pctni.org), [pct.bike](https://pct.bike) and other apps of your choice.
