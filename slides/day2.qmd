## Routing Server Cost Summary

**VM Configuration:** - e2-medium instance (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM) - Spot pricing (60-90% discount) - Europe-west2 region

**Estimated Daily Cost:** - On-demand: \~\$0.034/hour - Spot discount: \~70% = \~\$0.010/hour - **Per day (24h):** \~\$0.24

**Monthly Estimate:** \~\$7-8

**Additional Costs:** - Disk storage: \~\$0.04/month - Network egress: Free for 1 GB/day, then \~\$0.12/GB - Spot interruptions possible but cost-effective for non-critical workloads

*Prices approximate; use GCP Pricing Calculator for current rates.*
