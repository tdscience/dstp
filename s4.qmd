# Spatio-temporal data with OD data

This exercise is based on the tutorial "Analysing massive open human mobility data in R using spanishoddata, duckdb and flowmaps" by Egor Kotov [@kotov2025].

This is a more advanced exercise that benefits from having a fast internet connection, decent compute resources, and an interest in the Iberian Peninsula.

There are three main parts, all of which can be found at [ekotov.pro](https://www.ekotov.pro/agit-2025-spanishoddata/):

- [Setting up the software](https://www.ekotov.pro/agit-2025-spanishoddata/software-setup.html)
- [Importing the data](https://www.ekotov.pro/agit-2025-spanishoddata/1-mobility-data.html)
