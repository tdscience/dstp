## Welcome!

Data Science for Transport Planning

**2-day course**

18-19 September 2025

## Agenda

-   **10:00-11:00** Introduction to Data Science for Transport Planning
-   11:00-12:30 Finding, importing and cleaning transport datasets
-   12:30-13:30 Lunch
-   13:30-15:00 Origin-destination data analysis
-   15:00-15:15 Break and refreshments
-   15:15-17:00 OD Transport data visualisation

## Prerequisites

### To run the code

-   Computer to run the code
    -   Either: A laptop with R, RStudio or VS Code and Docker or similar installed to run the code locally
    -   Or: Access to a cloud-based environment for data science (e.g., GitHub Codespaces or Posit Cloud)

## Learn and share

The following will help:

-   An interest in transport planning and knowledge of transport datasets
-   A willingness to learn and share 
-   A GitHub account (to ask questions on the Discussions page and share your own code)
-   Familiarity with data science tools, e.g. R, Python, RStudio, VS Code

## Housekeeping

-   Connect to the UoL-Guest Wi-Fi network and enter your details.
-   GitHub account sign-up if not done already.
-   R and RStudio installation check, locally or in cloud environment.
-   Coffee and lunch: in the social space just outside this room
-   Toilets: Along the corridor and then left

## Setup check

To check you have the necessary software installed, try running the following code.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
pkgs = c("tidyverse", "stats19")
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install(pkgs)
```

You should be able to generate the map on the next slide.

## Setup check: The result

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(stats19)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
collisions_2023 = stats19::get_stats19(year = 2023, type = "collision")
collisions_2023_sf = stats19::format_sf(collisions_2023)
collisions_west_yorkshire_sf = collisions_2023_sf |>
  filter(police_force == "West Yorkshire") |>
  arrange(desc(accident_severity))
```

```{r}
#| label: plot
#| echo: false
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = collisions_west_yorkshire_sf,
    aes(colour = accident_severity, alpha = accident_severity)
  ) +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.8, 0.4, 0.2))
```

### Over to you

## The origins of the course

### "If only I was told this earlier in my career"

Imagine a workflow that enabled:

-   Fewer context switches
-   More focus on *the content* and not style of the work
-   Integration of code into your research manuscript
-   Automatic generation of results, including figures and tables...
    -   That change seamlessly when input datasets or code changes
-   Control over how you export and publish your work
    -   Including publication-quality PDFs, website, blogs, slides
-   Full reproducibility
-   You to share your work for maximum benefit to others

## Reproducible research

"Research is considered to be reproducible when the exact results can be reproduced if given access to the original data, software, or code." Source: [displayr.com](https://www.displayr.com/what-is-reproducible-research/)

## Stages of open and reproducible science

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
1.  Open access to the publications

2.  Open access to sample (synthetic if sensitive) data

3.  Open access to the code

4.  Fully reproducible paper published with documentation

5.  Project deployed in tool for non-specialist use

## Course principles

::: incremental
-   "Learn by doing"
-   "Learn by teaching"
-   "Learn from each other"
-   "We're all learning"
-   "Growth mindset"
-   "Can-do" and "Go for It" attitude
-   "Every error is a learning opportunity"
-   "No such thing as a bad question"
-   "Fail fast"
-   Balance between focused work and comms
-   Bring you own principles (BYOP)
:::

## The practical sessions

-   Time of in-depth work
-   Use the course website as a reference point but spend most of the time in your own environment
-   I will support people 1-2-1 and do 'live demos' now and then
